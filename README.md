# Linux-Based Mail Server

## Overview
This project aims to create a command-line email system for Linux. It allows users to send and receive emails through the Linux terminal, making email automation, scripting, and customization accessible. The mail server utilizes open-source technologies, ensuring security, privacy, and compatibility across different Linux distributions.

## Objectives
- **Create a secure, efficient mail server** on Red Hat Linux.
- **Integrate components** like Sendmail, Postfix, Dovecot, and PHP to provide a robust email platform.
- Implement **secure transmission** with SSL/TLS encryption and optimize email storage using the Maildir format.
- Provide an **administrator account** for server management and user control.

## Features
- **Email Sending and Receiving**: Send and receive emails via terminal with integrated MTA (Sendmail & Postfix) and MDA (Dovecot).
- **Secure Transmission**: Uses SSL/TLS protocols for encrypted communication.
- **Spam Filtering**: Integrated SpamAssassin to filter unwanted emails.
- **Webmail Interface**: Provides an accessible, user-friendly web interface for email management.
- **Log Analysis**: Administrators can access detailed server logs to monitor and troubleshoot the mail server.
- **User Management**: Allows creation of users for both senders and receivers.

## Technologies Used
- **Sendmail**: For sending emails.
- **Postfix**: For email reception and forwarding.
- **Dovecot**: For managing incoming emails and supporting IMAP/POP3 protocols.
- **PHP**: For webmail interface.
- **Linux**: Running on Red Hat Linux with the use of open-source tools like Maildir for email storage.

## System Requirements
- **Hardware**: Minimum 1.0 GHz multi-core CPU, 2GB RAM, 20GB of hard disk space.
- **Software**: Red Hat Linux, Postfix Server, Dovecot, PHP.

## Installation
1. Install **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, and **PHP** on your Red Hat Linux machine.
2. Configure components for email sending, receiving, and storage using the Maildir format.
3. Set up the webmail interface for easy email management.
4. Configure **SSL/TLS** encryption for secure email transmission.
5. Implement spam filtering using **SpamAssassin**.

## Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Validate each component for proper functionality.
- **Security Testing**: Ensure the server is secure against potential vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the server can handle heavy loads without issues.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involve end-users to assess the usability of the webmail interface.

## Results
The implementation successfully integrates the components, achieving a secure and efficient mail server. It performs well under load, provides real-time resource monitoring, and enables secure email communication.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Security**: Implement additional encryption protocols and multi-factor authentication.
- **Machine Learning for Threat Detection**: Use AI for enhanced email threat detection.
- **Cloud Integration**: Integrate with cloud platforms for improved scalability.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Add features for real-time document collaboration.

## Conclusion
This project successfully integrates multiple open-source components to create a secure and efficient email system on Red Hat Linux, enhancing both user experience and administrative control.
